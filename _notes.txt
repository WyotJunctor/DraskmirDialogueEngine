Plannin and shit

Notions -
 * planning graph
    - aggregated view of entity types & associations w/ aggregated outcomes
 * entity labels / categories
    - entities associated with these to drive planning
 * effect rules "summarized" as result nodes in planning graph
    - results labeled with importance, certainty, probability & causal entities
 * curious vs. remediative actions
    - curious minimizes uncertainty, remediative minimizes risk
    - weighting between them - remediative usually weighted higher (significantly)
 * ideals vs. needs
    - parameters for ideals (what is understood as satisfying them)
    - ideals drive long-term strategy, needs drive short-term planning
 * importance, certainty, probability
    - used to score actions & results for desirability & undesirability
 * actions vs. reactions in the action resolution process
    - reactions for deconflicting invalidated actions
 * planning rules used to label planning graph nodes w/ imp, cert, prob
    - cold associations between entity labels & results, hot labeling of real entities
 * action rules determine which plans are possible, plans which actions desirable
    - dot prod of desirability of plan w/ suitability of action
 * player-facing info driven by AI-like planning and judgement graphs
    - suggestions and easy-read info provided by AI-oriented filters
 * NPC generation rules relative to player character state
    - e.g. narrative driven by generating NPC w/ aligned goals but misaligned ideals


Action & Reaction Game Loop

1. Game prompts entities for actions
2. Actions handed as a bundle to Objective Reality (O.R.)
3. O.R. iterates over actions, running validation rules
    a. automatically transforms invalid actions to valid if no conflict
    b. marks conflicting invalid actions dirty for future processing
4. O.R. attempts to deconflict invalid actions with subjective input
    a. pulling action-local subgraph & possible objectively-possible reactions
    b. subjective reality prunes reactions & adds dumb shit
    c. chooses best reaction based on its effect when applied to the subgraph
5. O.R. takes fully valid action set & adds to graph
6. O.R. runs in parallel 'setup' effect rules, adding contexts, relationships, etc.
7. O.R. runs in parallel 'result' effect rules, producing mechanical changes
    . (e.g. adding 'dead' from wounds)
8. O.R. runs in parallel 'teardown' effect rules, removing contexts, nodes, etc.
    . (e.g. removing 'person' from dead)
9. O.R. bundles all deltas into graph message
    a. propagates to subjective graphs
10. repeat!
